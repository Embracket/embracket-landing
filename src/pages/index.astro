			<h1>Embracket</h1>
			<h2>Under renovation!</h2>
			<p>This website is based of a foundation I started building when I was 16. I have since then graduated "gymnasiet", and am now in my second year of university. I have throughout learnt a ton, and I would like to update my website to represent that. </p>
			<p>While I'm impressed with what I was able to achieve purely using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it is time to move on to a more modern solution. When I have time, I will migrate this website to a stack using Astro.js and Solid.js.</p>
			<p>If you still wish to proceed to the old version of the website, navigate there using the button below.</p>
